## Graphics Philosophy

Following Palia's approach, Vintage Beef aims for:
- Stylized, appealing visuals rather than photorealism
- Optimized performance for lower-end GPUs
- Clear, readable art style
- Warm, inviting color palette
- Efficient use of resources (textures, polygons, shaders)

## Terrain System (NEW in v0.3.1!)

Vintage Beef now features **three terrain systems** to choose from:

### 1. Simple Terrain
- Flat plane for quick testing
- Best performance
- Basic gameplay

### 2. Procedural Terrain (Heightmap)
- Varied landscapes with hills and valleys
- Multiple biomes with different colors
- Good performance
- Procedural textures
- Best for exploration without terraforming

### 3. Voxel Terrain (FULLY TERRAFORMABLE! 🎉)
- **Complete terrain modification** - dig, mine, build!
- **Chunk-based system** for infinite worlds
- **Cave generation** with 3D noise
- **Real-time updates** - changes appear instantly
- **13 voxel types** including ores
- **Greedy meshing** for optimized rendering
- **Player tools** for easy terraforming
- Minecraft-style block building

**Quick Setup:**
1. In GameWorld scene, create "TerrainSystem" GameObject
2. Add `TerrainManager` component
3. Set **Terrain Type** to your choice (Voxel for terraforming!)
4. Add `VoxelTerraformingTool` to Player for digging/building
5. Press Play!
